# Grafeo Server — Multi-variant Docker build
#
# Build targets:
#   docker build --target gwp      -t grafeo-server:gwp .
#   docker build --target bolt     -t grafeo-server:bolt .
#   docker build --target standard -t grafeo-server:standard .
#   docker build --target full     -t grafeo-server:full .
#
# Default target (no --target) builds "standard".
#
# Tiers:
#   gwp      — GWP (gRPC), GQL + storage, no HTTP/UI
#   bolt     — Bolt v5, Cypher + storage, no HTTP/UI
#   standard — HTTP + Studio UI + all languages + algos + storage (default)
#   full     — HTTP + GWP + Bolt + Studio + AI + auth + TLS + schemas
